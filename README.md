# EVCharge
Used React native for it
Basic building steps like pull the repository and build using react native cli
no expo or any other is used
Asks for permission to fetch the users location
points a marker when marker is moved and fetches the new coordinates
fetches charger location from the json file stores locally
react-native-maps 
Maps sdk
api key
basically focused on android as I don't have apple machine
react-native-geolocation to update users location
flatlist
didn't worked much on ui part
react-native-view-shot for screen capture
fetch or axios for posting content
